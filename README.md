# FIRST 2022 Threat-Informed Defense Workshop

This repository was created for the FIRST Threat-Informed Defense workshop. 

The workshop will start with the process of taking in new threat intel reports and identifying MITRE ATT&CK techniques. From there we will integrate the new techniques into the ATT&CK Workbench to allow us to centralize our ATT&CK-connected threat intel. We will model the intel to help us understand the full sequence of events described in the intel and develop and test approaches to mitigation.

This session will be hands on. Attendees should bring laptops that they can install and run Docker containers on. 

This session will leverage publicly available research developed by the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/):
- Attack Flow - https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-flow/
- ATT&CK Workbench - https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-workbench/

## Agenda
- **Intro**
- **Turning CTI reports into ATT&CK techniques:** We will read through a CTI report and see how we can turn prose into TTPs
- **Customizing ATT&CK with Workbench:** ATT&CK Workbench is a publicly available tool that allows you to extend ATT&CK by importing your own adversaries, techniques, or red team activities. We will identify each of them from the CTI report and add them into Workbench. 
-- **ATT&CK Navigator** import extended ATT&CK matrix from workbench, import 800-53 controls, look at gaps
-- **Custom ATT&CK Website** show your extended information in traditional ATT&CK view. Website allows for more detail 
- **Turning ATT&CK into Attack Flows:**
Attack Flow creates a common language to describe and visualize a series of adversary attacks. Building off the CTI that was added to Workbench, we will build an Attack Flow to visualize the attack. 
- **Identifying & validating security controls with ATT&CK:**
Now that we’ve identified an adversary, visualized the ATT&CK, we will show how to mitigate that attack with security controls, and then validate those controls with red team activities. 


## Software Installation
The ATT&CK Workbench section of the agenda will require the setup and installation of the ATT&CK Workbench, a local copy of the ATT&CK Navigator, and a local copy of the ATT&CK website. 

**Please follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful install.**

### 1. Required Software
#### Git
We recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for simplicity, but any git client will work
#### NodeJS
You can download NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
#### Angular CLI
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
#### Docker Desktop
[Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)  
[Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
#### Python
Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
#### PIP
Mac - `$ python -m ensurepip --upgrade`  
Windows - `py -m ensurepip --upgrade`

### 2. Required Git Repositories
#### ATT&CK Workbench
The ATT&CK Workbench is comprised of three Git repositories. All three reposiories need to be under the same parent directory.  

##### ATT&CK Workbench Frontend
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend.git
```
##### ATT&CK Workbench API
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api.git
```
##### ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager.git
```  
##### ATT&CK Workbench Configuration
To eliminate timeouts, replace `attack-workbench-frontend/nginx/nginx.conf` with this updated [.conf file](nginx.conf)  
To make the Workbench database persistent, replace `attack-workbench-frontend/docker-compose.yml` with this [updated file](docker-compose.yml)

### ATT&CK Navigator

#### ATT&CK Navigator Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator.git
```

#### ATT&CK Navigator Configuration
To point Navigator at your workbench, replace `attack-navigator/nav-app/src/assests/config.json` with this [updated file](config.json)  

### Local ATT&CK Website
#### ATT&CK  Website Repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website.git
```
##### ATT&CK  Website Configuration
To point Website at your local instance of Workbench, replace `attack-website/modules/site_config.py` with this [updated file](site_config.py)  

## 3. Building ATT&CK Workbench
### Build docker images
**YOU MUST START THE DOCKER DAEMON BEFORE RUNNING DOCKER COMPOSE**  
You can do this by starting docker desktop.  

1. Navigate to the `attack-workbench-frontend` directory (containing the `docker-compose.yml` file)
2. Run the command:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

This command will build all of the necessary Docker images and run the corresponding Docker containers.

### Access Docker instance

With the docker-compose running you can access the ATT&CK Workbench application by visiting the URL `localhost` in your browser.

## 4. Building ATT&CK Navigator
### Build the server
1. Navigate to `/attack-navigator/nav-app`
2. Run `npm install`

### Serve application on local machine

1. Run `ng serve` within `/attack-navigator/nav-app`
2. Browse to `localhost:4200` in browser

## 5. Building the ATT&CK Website

### Install requirements

1. Create a virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
    - Windows: `py -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `env/Scripts/activate.bat`
3. Install requirement packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Build and serve the local site

1. Update `navigator_link` field within `modules/site-config.py` to point to local navigator instance. This will link the website with your custom Navigator
```shell
navigator_link = “http://localhost:4200/” 
```
2. Update local ATT&CK data:   
   `python3 update-attack.py`  
   Note: `update-attack.py`, has many optional command line arguments which affect the behavior of the build. Run `python3 update-attack.py -h` for a list of arguments and an explanation of their functionality.  
3. Serve the html to `localhost:8000`: 
    1. `cd output`
    2. `python3 -m pelican.server`

**Refreshing website content** - to refresh the website based on modified ATT&CK Workbench data run the following commands from your ATT&CK Website directory:
1. Stop the pelican server by pressing control-c in the terminal window for the runing website. 
2. Update your web pages:
   `python3 update-attack.py`
3. Serve the html to `localhost:8000`: 
    1. `cd output`
    2. `python3 -m pelican.server`

### (Optional) Installing, building, and serving the site via Docker 

1. Build the docker image:
  ``` 
docker build -t workshop_website .
```
2. Run a docker container:
```
docker run --name attack_website -d -p 8888:80 workshop_website
```
