# FIRST 2022 Threat-Informed Defense Workshop

This repository was created for the FIRST Threat-Informed Defense workshop. 

The workshop will start with the process of taking in new threat intel reports and identifying MITRE ATT&CK techniques. From there we will integrate the new techniques into the ATT&CK Workbench to allow us to centralize our ATT&CK-connected threat intel. We will model the intel to help us understand the full sequence of events described in the intel and develop and test approaches to mitigation.

This session will be hands on. Attendees should bring laptops that they can install and run Docker containers on. 

This session will leverage publicly available research developed by the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/):
- Attack Flow - https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-flow/
- ATT&CK Workbench - https://ctid.mitre-engenuity.org/our-work/attack-workbench/

## Agenda
- **Intro** A short overview of the Cetner for Threat-Informed Defense, our R&D program, and how to get involved. 
- **Identifying ATT&CK Techniques in CTI reports:** We will read through a CTI report and see how we can turn prose into TTPs.
- **Extending & Customizing ATT&CK:** ATT&CK Workbench is a publicly available tool that allows you to extend ATT&CK by importing your own adversaries, techniques, or red team activities. We will identify each of them from the CTI report and add them into Workbench. 
-- **ATT&CK Navigator** import extended ATT&CK matrix from workbench, import 800-53 controls, look at gaps.
-- **Custom ATT&CK Website** show your extended information in traditional ATT&CK view. Website allows for more detail.
- **Building Attack Flows with ATT&CK:**
Attack Flow creates a common language to describe and visualize a series of adversary attacks. Building off the CTI that was added to Workbench, we will build an Attack Flow to visualize the attack. 
- **Using Security Controls to Identify Gaps:**
Now that weâ€™ve identified an adversary, visualized the ATT&CK, we will show how to mitigate that attack with security controls, and then validate those controls with red team activities.

`npm install -g @angular/cli`
#### PIP (installed through command line)
Mac - `$ python -m ensurepip --upgrade`  
Windows - `py -m ensurepip --upgrade`

### 2. Required Git Repositories
All repos should be under the same parent folder. 
#### ATT&CK Workbench
The ATT&CK Workbench is comprised of three Git repositories. 

##### ATT&CK Workbench Frontend
Through Github Desktop:  
```
https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend.git
```
Through git CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend.git
```
##### ATT&CK Workbench API
Through Github Desktop:
```
https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api.git
```
Through git CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api.git
```
##### ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager
Through Github Desktop:
```
https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager.git
```
Through git CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager.git
```  
##### ATT&CK Workbench Configuration
To eliminate timeouts, replace `./attack-workbench-frontend/nginx/nginx.conf` with this updated [.conf file](nginx.conf)  
To make the Workbench database persistent, replace `./attack-workbench-frontend/docker-compose.yml` with this [updated file](docker-compose.yml)

### ATT&CK Navigator

#### ATT&CK Navigator Repo
Through Github Desktop:
```
https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator.git
```
Through git CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator.git
```

#### ATT&CK Navigator Configuration
To point Navigator at your workbench, replace `./attack-navigator/nav-app/src/assests/config.json` with this [updated file](config.json)  

### Local ATT&CK Website
#### ATT&CK  Website Repo 
Through Github Desktop:
```
https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website.git
```
Through git CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-website.git
```
##### ATT&CK  Website Configuration
To point Website at your local instance of Workbench and Navigator, replace `./attack-website/modules/site_config.py` with this [updated file](site_config.py)  

## 3. Building ATT&CK Workbench
### Build docker images
**YOU MUST START THE DOCKER DAEMON BEFORE RUNNING DOCKER COMPOSE**  
You can do this by starting docker desktop.  

1. Navigate to the `./attack-workbench-frontend` directory (containing the `docker-compose.yml` file)
2. Run the command:
```
docker-compose up
```

This command will build all of the necessary Docker images and run the corresponding Docker containers.

### Access Workbench

With the docker-compose running you can access the ATT&CK Workbench application by visiting the URL `localhost` in your browser. To shut down Workbench, open a new terminal to `./attack-workbench-frontend` and run
```
docker-compose down
```

## 4. Building ATT&CK Navigator
### Build the server
1. Navigate to `./attack-navigator/nav-app`
2. Run `npm install`

### Serve application on local machine

1. Run `ng serve` within `./attack-navigator/nav-app`
2. Browse to `localhost:4200` in browser

## 5. Building the ATT&CK Website

### Install requirements

1. Create a virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
    - Windows: `py -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: 
    - macOS and Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `env/Scripts/activate.bat`
3. Install requirement packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Build and serve the local site

1. Update local ATT&CK data:   
   `python3 update-attack.py`  
   Note: `update-attack.py`, has many optional command line arguments which affect the behavior of the build. Run `python3 update-attack.py -h` for a list of arguments and an explanation of their functionality.  
2. Serve the html to `localhost:8000`: 
    1. `cd output`
    2. `python3 -m pelican.server`

**Refreshing website content** - to refresh the website based on modified ATT&CK Workbench data run the following commands from your ATT&CK Website directory:
1. Stop the pelican server by pressing `ctrl-c` in the terminal window for the running website. 
2. Update your web pages:
   `cd ..`
   `python3 update-attack.py`
3. Serve the html to `localhost:8000`: 
    1. `cd output`
    2. `python3 -m pelican.server`
